# Car Rental System in C++

## Project Description

This is a simple **Car Rental System** implemented in C++ that allows users to browse, select, and rent cars from a predefined list of options. The system presents the available cars, displays detailed information for each choice, and allows the user to confirm the rental. The program also includes a basic login system for access control.

### Key Features:

- **Car List Display**: A menu shows the available cars with their company names.
- **Car Details**: The system provides detailed information about the selected car, including:
  - Company
  - Model
  - Color
  - Maximum Speed
  - Fuel Type
  - Manufacturer
  - Price
- **Rental Confirmation**: After selecting a car, the user can choose whether to rent it. Upon confirmation, the system displays the car details and acknowledges the rental.
- **Login System**: A basic login mechanism with password protection for accessing the system.

### Functionalities:

- **Menu Navigation**: Users can navigate through a menu to view available cars and their details.
- **Rental Confirmation**: Users are asked if they want to rent the selected car and can confirm or cancel the action.
- **Login Authentication**: A simple password-based login system ensures that only authorized users can access the rental system.
  
### Controls:

- **Input**: User input is handled via the console, where users can select a car, confirm rental, or exit the system.
- **Login**: The login system prompts for a password. If correct, access is granted; otherwise, the user must try again.

### How to Run:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the C++ file using any C++ compiler (such as GCC, Visual Studio, or Code::Blocks).
3. Follow the instructions in the console to browse and rent cars.

### Technologies Used:

- **C++**: Core programming language used to implement the system.
- **Conio.h**: For handling console input and password masking.
- **Stdlib.h**: For using system commands to clear the screen and pause the console.
